I am a Software Engineer that like to implement best practice. My best strength is result oriented with excellent foundation. However, I've also included clear documentation and haven't forgotten about performance. I used to be a freelancer since college until now by making some brilliant work. Such as creating / maintaining websites, making APIs, mobile apps, teaching / tutoring and others. I have also achieved a number of regional and national achievements.

My skill and knowledge:
✔️Frontend (React.js, HTML5, CSS3, Responsive Web, SASS)
✔️ Backend (REST API & WebSocket, PHP, Node.js, GO and event-messaging like Pushpin API)
✔️ Microservice Architecture
✔️ Database (MySQL, MariaDB, Postgres, MongoDB, Firebase, Redis, Elasticsearch)
✔️ DevOps (Webserver - Nginx & Apache, Container - Docker, Shell Scripting, Git)

Currently I am actively working in the company, working on some personal projects and keep learning new technology. 🔥
